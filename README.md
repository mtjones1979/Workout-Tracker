  ## Description 
  The Workout Tracker is an app which allows the user to add exercises to a database and view a page which displays summary data on the last seven workouts.  The homepage allows the user to either choose a new Workout or continue with the most recent workout.

  ## Installation
  I used Express, MongoDB database to store the data, used Mongoose to set up the schema and the provided HTML pages and javascript to have it function.

  ## Test
  You can click on the heroku link to start the app.  Then it will ask you to either continue your workout or do a new workout. You can view the dashboard to see your last 7 days of results.
